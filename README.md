## About

Hi! I'm Ej.

I am a senior undergraduate student at Zhejiang University majoring in Computer Science, also a member of the [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/).


I'm interested is in computational linguistics and particularly cross-lingual topics. I'm also open to explore LLM, LLM & HCI topics, and computational social science. As a pseudo-polyglot, my off time is often spent on learning languages.

I will be in Oxford for my senior year. I am looking forward to meeting new friends and exploring new research opportunities there.
